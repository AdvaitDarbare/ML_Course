'''
1. Why Regularize?
- minimizes overfitting, executed during the model fitting step
- embeded feature selection
- how well it can generalize from known to unknown data
- Regularization makes sure that our model is still accurate

2. What is overfitting?
- model is able to represent a particular set of points but not new data well is overfitting
- It fits the training data well but performs significantly worse on test data
- It typically has more parameters than necessary, i.e., it has high model complexity
- It might be fitting for features that are multi-collinear (i.e., features that are highly negatively or positively correlated)
- It might be fitting the noise in the data and likely mistaking the noise for features
- For instance if the R-squared score is high for training data but the model performs poorly on test data, itâ€™s a strong indicator of overfitting.
