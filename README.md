## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms, techniques, and examples. It is intended to serve as a reference for students and practitioners who are learning about machine learning or looking for implementations of specific algorithms.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It includes tasks such as classification and regression.

### Decision Trees

Decision Trees are used for classification and regression tasks. They work by splitting the data into subsets based on the value of input features.

- **Code**: See the `DecisionTrees` directory for implementation details.

### Feature Engineering - Numerical Transformations

Feature Engineering involves transforming raw data into meaningful features that better represent the underlying problem to predictive models.

- **Code**: See the `FeatureEngineering-NumericalTransformations` directory for implementation details.

### Feature Selection

Feature Selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction.

- **Code**: See the `FeatureSelection` directory for implementation details.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

K-Nearest Neighbors is an instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression.

- **Code**: See the `K_nearestNeighbors` directory for implementation details.

### Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

- **Code**: See the `LinearRegression` directory for implementation details.

### Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is used for binary classification problems and models the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class.

- **Code**: See the `LogisticRegression` directory for implementation details.

### Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes classifiers are simple probabilistic classifiers based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features.

- **Code**: See the `NaiveBayes` directory for implementation details.

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Support Vector Machines are supervised learning models used for classification and regression by finding the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes.

- **Code**: See the `SupportVectorMachine` directory for implementation details.

### Regularization and Hyperparameter Tuning

Regularization is used to prevent overfitting, while hyperparameter tuning involves optimizing the hyperparameters of a model to improve its performance.

- **Code**: See the `Regularization` directory for implementation details.

### Random Forests

Random Forests are an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

- **Code**: See the `RandomForests` directory for implementation details.

### Boosting ML Models

Boosting is an ensemble technique that combines the predictions of several base estimators to improve robustness over a single estimator.

- **Code**: See the `Boosting` directory for implementation details.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning involves learning patterns from unlabeled data. It includes tasks such as clustering and dimensionality reduction.

### K-Means Clustering

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters.

- **Code**: See the `KmeansClustering` directory for implementation details.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Principal Component Analysis is a technique used to emphasize variation and bring out strong patterns in a dataset, reducing its dimensionality.

- **Code**: See the `Principal_component_analysis` directory for implementation details.
